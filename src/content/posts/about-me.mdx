Iâ€™m a musician and software developer based in London. I'm currently a software developer at [Focusrite Audio Engineering](https://focusrite.com/), where I work on C++ software that interacts with audio interfaces, such as [Scarlett](https://focusrite.com/scarlett).

Before that, I studied MA Computational Arts at Goldsmiths, and BMus Creative Music Technology at Surrey.

I'm a multi-instrumentalist and play music in a variety of genres and bands, such as [Icebeing](https://www.icebeing.com/).
