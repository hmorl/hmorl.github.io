This is the website I made for my MA degree show, "So, How is _That_ Working For You?" (5-8 Sept 2019).

It was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator, and makes use of a monospace font and the `ch` unit in CSS to perfectly align the ASCII art design to a grid.

The map was implemented by Julia Makivic, the custom font and animation were made by Julien Mercier.
