I recently did a talk at the [Audio Developer Conference](https://audio.dev/) about building screen reader accessible apps using [JUCE](https://juce.com). The video will be available online soon, but in the meantime, you can check out the resources and slides in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/FocusriteGroup/accessible-juce-app-adc-23).
