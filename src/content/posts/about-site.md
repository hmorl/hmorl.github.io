Forever under construction ðŸš§

This is my personal site which I'm continuously tinkering as a web project, but it's also a place where I'll share various musical and coding projects. Sort of like a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

If you're interested, it's currently built using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework and is hosted [here](https://github.com/hmorl/hmorl.github.io) on GitHub.
